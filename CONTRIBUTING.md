## 💡 Pro-Tips for a Great File

* **Be Welcoming:** Use an inviting tone. A little "Thank you" goes a long way! 😊
* **Label Issues:** If you have easy tasks for beginners, label them as `good first issue` in your GitHub repository.
* **Automation:** Mention if you have CI/CD pipelines that will automatically test their code.
* **Formatting:** Use headers and bold text (as seen above) to make it easy to skim.
